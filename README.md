# CS-350

This project was aimed at developing an embedded system for a thermostat. The goal was to create a system that could control temperature based on user input by pressing one button to increase the setpoint and another button to decrease the setpoint. It also involved indicating heat status using an LED, reading temperature from sensors, and periodically sending data to a UART for display.

## Achievements

I believe several aspects of this project were executed well:

1. **Task Scheduler**: The task scheduler was implemented efficiently to manage periodic tasks such as temperature reading, LED control, and data output.

2. **Peripheral Integration**: The integration of various hardware peripherals, including GPIO, UART, I2C, and Timer, was seamless.

3. **User Interaction**: The system successfully responded to user input by allowing them to adjust the setpoint using buttons, enhancing user experience.

4. **Problem-Solving**: I effectively tackled challenges, particularly in debugging and hardware interfacing, by applying structured approaches to resolve issues.

## Areas for Improvement

While I consider the project a success, there are areas for improvement:

1. **Security Considerations**: The project didn't address security aspects. In a real-world scenario, considering security vulnerabilities and implementing safeguards would be critical.

2. **Optimization**: The code could be further optimized to minimize resource usage and improve efficiency.

3. **Scalability**: The project is relatively simple, and it could be enhanced to accommodate more advanced features, such as remote control via a mobile app.

## Tools and Resources

Throughout the project, I relied on several resources:

- **Official Documentation**: The official documentation for the microcontroller and peripheral libraries was a valuable reference.

- **Online Forums**: Online forums and communities provided insights into troubleshooting specific issues.

- **Textbooks and Online Tutorials**: Textbooks and online tutorials helped me grasp fundamental concepts in embedded systems.

## Transferable Skills

Several skills acquired during this project are highly transferable:

1. **Problem-Solving**: The ability to break down complex issues and troubleshoot effectively is applicable to various engineering and programming tasks.

2. **Peripheral Integration**: Understanding how to integrate different hardware peripherals can be applied to a wide range of embedded systems projects.

3. **Coding Proficiency**: The programming skills developed are transferable to other software development projects in different domains.

## Maintainability and Adaptability

To make the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I implemented the following practices:

- **Modular Code**: The code is organized into modules, making it easy to understand and modify specific functionalities without affecting the entire system.

- **Comments and Documentation**: I added comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of functions and sections, making it more readable and maintainable.

- **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected situations gracefully.

- **Clear Naming Conventions**: Meaningful variable and function names were chosen to enhance code clarity.
